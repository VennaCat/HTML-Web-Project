<h1>A few hours later, school was closed and you went back home with your frineds again.</h1>
<p>Once you've finished lunch, you were ready to do your first ever homework.</p>
<p>And it was not hard that at all.</p>
<p>That was so easy to do that it only took you 15 minutes to do.</p>
<p>But not as expected, this year was special, and you're about to find out you're gonna be the hero of this year, saving a whole school. Aren't you excited?</p>
