<h1>After you and the rest of the students of your class escaped with you,</h1>
<p>Everyone run out of the school with you and immediatly shouted to a random adult for help and, in the end, the cups captured Ronald and he could no longer kill more people. You saved most people of the school.</p>
<p>Ronald was sent to prison cell and there was no other day like that again, of course.</p>
<p>You were crying for joy thinking that your a super hero, but everyone else called you instead a life saver.</p>
<p>That was simply the end.</p>
